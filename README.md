### Notes

__Signed networks are the default in tidycoex__  
For a nice explanation of why signed networks are usually preferable, see the article [Signed or unsigned: which network type is preferable?](https://peterlangfelder.com/2018/11/25/signed-or-unsigned-which-network-type-is-preferable/) by Peter Langfelder.
